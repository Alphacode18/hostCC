# RDMA Benchmarks 

This directory provides wrappers to run simple RDMA benchmarks, using the perftest tool.

perftest is already available as part of MLX OFED (at least with version >=5.0). Ensure that same MLX OFED version is installed at the clients and servers for ensuring correct performance.

perftest can also downloaded from: https://github.com/linux-rdma/perftest
